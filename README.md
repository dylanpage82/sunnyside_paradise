## Getting Started
[TrelloBoard](https://trello.com/b/bY2zvuo8/vacation-destination)\
[ERD](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/43ac06cc-1047-4923-b6d5-c23bb21eecde/edit?beaconFlowId=10E7ABCF3FCFBC69&invitationId=inv_8e00a7a2-18a7-4e08-9539-ecadc3c9cb11&page=0_0#)

## Unsolved Problems
I was unable to solve the problem of the error message being displayed for half a second while the page switches.

## Future Enhancment 

I would like to implement react-admin and create a admin panel that only the admin has access to. I would also like to make it to were a user can add vacations to a wish list
